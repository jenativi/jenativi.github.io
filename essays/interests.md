## If (likeCoding == true), return “Work in software engineering”

If only I could explain my interest in software engineering in terms of coding then this writing would be much simpler. But I can not just simply say that likeCoding is true and therefore I have interests in software engineering. So instead of explaining my interest in coding languages like Java, C, or Python, I will explain them in my own beautiful words. 

Growing up as a videogamer, technology came easy to me.  I remember using a computer when I was only in the first grade. So by the time I reached highschool and started thinking about my future career, choosing computer science was an easy choice. At the start of my computer science career I had gained an interest in developing a project that could help with disabilities. So as my second year project in highschool I came up with an idea for my group to create an app that helps individuals with speech difficulties. This group project inspired me to create more projects concerning individuals with disabilities and I can help not just my community but also people outside it.

Another interest I have with software engineering is learning about video game design. Video games have always been a big part of my life. I have gained some of my friends through video games and I have always wanted to incorporate it into my career. Lately, I’ve wanted to learn more about incorporating psychology into game design and how it could produce a new way of playing video games.

## var newExperiences = “Artificial Intelligence”, “Data Structure”

Some new skills and experiences I hope to learn from software engineering are artificial intelligence and data structures. I want to learn more about artificial intelligence because it will rapidly become prevalent and I believe that it will soon be used everywhere. Another skill I hope to learn about are Data structures. I want to excel and understand them to the fullest.
