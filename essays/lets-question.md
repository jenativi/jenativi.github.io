In Eric Raymond’s essay How to Ask Questions the Smart Way, Raymond explains how to form a smart and efficient question within a forum and online community. 
Upon reading this essay I realized that there are a lot of questions on the internet that were not well thought out. There are many different kinds of “not smart” questions on the internet. 
For example, some would post on an online forum asking for help without background information or any clarifications and some ask questions that could simply be answered through a simple web search and last. 
Some skills and techniques that Raymond pointed out when writing a smart question are writing in clear and grammatical language, being precise and informative, and last but not least writing an explicit question. 
For many, posting a question on an online forum could be their last resort to resolving an issue, or problem, or fixing a programming bug. But to other individuals, it is their first place to seek answers 
and this is the group of people who are most likely to ask unintelligent questions. 

## "Google it"

The phrase “Google it” has become such a common phrase in our modern society that sometimes we forget that we can actually “google” or search the web for questions that we have. In this [example](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77827171/can-we-develop-a-website-using-html-css-and-c), a 
user asked a simple question if it is possible to create a working website using HTML, CSS, and C++. At first glance, you would be shocked to see this question. You would think to 
yourself, “Of Course, you could make a website with HTML and CSS” but the user also asked if you could use C++ for backend programming. In a way, this is a dumb question. First of all, this question 
could have been easily answered through a web search. In other words, the user could have “Googled” it. This is why it’s important to conduct research and to know what you are asking the public.

## A Precise Question

Many questions could be easily answered using the method “Google it” but in this [example](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2607289/converting-array-to-list-in-java), the user has done research and “Googled" their problem. In the post, the user asked how to convert an array to a list in Java. 
They also included that they were using a certain type of method in Java that would convert the array. The post’s question is precise but they also included research about the behavior changes of the method they were using. 
This question was concise and was easily given a solution and others explained the behavior of the method they were using.
