### Home Page: 
The home page will consist of a restroom of the day which will highlight a specific restroom on UH Manoa Campus. The home page will also consist of the top five rated restrooms on campus, which allows users to see the best restrooms rated by UH Manoa students. 

### Rated restrooms / Rate a Restroom:
Page of rated restrooms in a list based on scores. 
Allows logged-in users to leave ratings and reviews on a restroom. 
The list of restrooms can be filtered based on location, gender, and other factors. 

### Find restroom:
Site listing the different restrooms on campus, with a map to accompany it. Filters are available to sort out restrooms in a particular region of campus or in a certain building. 

### Your restrooms:
Your restrooms page will allow the user to see the restrooms that they have visited. This page will also show the users their previous reviews.


### Restroom Quest:
The more restrooms that you leave reviews on, the higher your level. As you level up, you earn titles. This helps with gamifying the app so that there is an incentive for using it.
