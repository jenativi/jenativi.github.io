## My Toolbox

Learning about software engineering is like starting with an empty toolbox. At first, you put in your first tool, and over time you add more and more to address every problem you might encounter. In software engineering, initially, you learn how to code, then you discover open-source coding and start using GitHub. Later, you might venture into web development, adding HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to your toolbox. Gradually, the tools in your toolbox accumulate, and suddenly you've gone from printing “Hello world” to creating an app that solves real problems. During my semester in ICS 314, this concept became clear to me. Every new topic felt like adding another tool to my toolbox. A few of those tools I acquired include Coding Standards and Ethics in Software Engineering.

## Coding Standards

One of the concepts I learned about in software engineering is coding standards. Coding standards are a set of guidelines that developers follow to write clear and consistent code. It is important to learn this concept because it ensures code clarity, simplifies maintenance, and supports effective collaboration across development teams. In my ICS 314 class we learned about coding standards for web development but coding standards is a concept that goes beyond that. Take data science, for example, where sticking to coding standards makes scripts easier to read, update, and share a real boon when you're working on team projects or managing data over time. 

## Ethics

The last concept I learned in software engineering is the ethics surrounding it. When taking software engineering one concept that most tend to ignore is ethics and responsible use. Learning about ethics in software engineering is crucial because it guides professionals in making responsible decisions that respect user privacy, ensure security, and promote fairness. Ethical considerations help in building trust with users by ensuring that technology serves the public good and does not harm society or individuals. This is especially important in today's digital age, where the impact of software extends across all aspects of life, from personal data protection to influencing social and economic behaviors. Additionally, the rise of Artificial Intelligence this year has put ethics into the spotlight with concerns about transparency and AI-based decisions. Learning about ethics in software engineering sparked something in me to put humanity first when developing applications and projects. At the end of the day, we as a society do not need an application that will end us all. 

## A Farewell

Reflecting on my journey through ICS 314, I realize how much I've grown not just in skill but also in understanding the deeper implications of what I create. From my first "Hello world" to complex applications, each step was not just about adding another tool but also about understanding the responsibility that comes with these tools. Learning coding standards and ethics has empowered me to not only build better software but to do so with a conscious effort toward ethical practices and collaborative success. This course has taught me that software engineering is much more than writing code; it's about building a foundation for responsible innovation that respects both individuals and society. As I move forward, I carry with me not just a toolbox of technical skills, but a guiding compass of ethical principles that will inform my decisions in this ever-evolving field.
