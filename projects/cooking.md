In this cooking video that I created for my Filipino class, I created a video to present in class on how to prepare and cook Butter Chicken. 

This video was part of a project in Filipino class where we had to pick a dish to research and create a cooking tutorial. In this video I learned how to cook Indian butter chicken that originated in Deli. I learned that dishes from India require a lot of different spices and it expanded my knowledge of cooking. The dish also takes a lot of preperation including, sauteing, blending, and frying parts of the curry to create a finish product. This project not only enhanced my cooking skills but also sparked a newfound curiosity to explore more international dishes, fostering a sense of cultural interconnectedness through the universal language of food.
