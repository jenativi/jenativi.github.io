In this cooking video that I created for my Filipino class, I created a video to present in class on how to prepare and cook Butter Chicken. 

## Cooking Butter Chicken 

This video was part of a project in Filipino class where we had to pick a dish to research and create a cooking tutorial. In this video, I learned how to cook Indian butter chicken that originated in Deli. I learned that dishes from India require a lot of different spices and it expanded my knowledge of cooking. The dish also takes a lot of preparation including, sauteing, blending, and frying parts of the curry to create a finished product. This project not only enhanced my cooking skills but also sparked a newfound curiosity to explore more international dishes, fostering a sense of cultural interconnectedness through the universal language of food.

## Bonding with Food 

Another interesting part about this project was when I had to present it in class. During class, each person who created a cooking video had to present it for everyone to watch. I found that experience delightful since everyone was able to share different cultures and parts of themselves in class that would not have normally been shared. For example, someone in the class decided to cook Sinigang which is a dish in the Philippines. Another person decided to bake a banana bread. It made me happy knowing that we all bonded about food even though everyone came from different backgrounds.
